# NASA Server Log Analytics Workshop
## Introduction
Security breaches happen. And when they do, your server logs may be your best line of defense. We take the server-log analysis to the next level by speeding and improving security forensics and providing a low cost platform to show compliance. The dataset which we are going to use in this demo is of NASA-HTTP. It has HTTP requests to the NASA Kennedy Space Center WWW server in Florida.
